To execute the Python Suduko Solver :-

METHOD 1:

    1. Input the data into <suduko.txt> file.
	
    2. Go to CMD and call the directory in which you have saved the program.
	
    3. Type "python suduko.py" into the command line and the answer to the puzzle will be displayed.
	
METHOD 2: 

    1. Input the data into <suduko.txt> file.
	
    2. Click the <RUN.bat> file and it will execute automatically.
