### PYTHON SUDKO SOLVER
To execute the Python Suduko Solver (for Windows users only) :-

METHOD 1:

    1. Input the data into <suduko.txt> file.
    
    2. Go to CMD and call the directory in which you have saved the program.
    
    3. Type "python suduko.py" into the command line and the answer to the puzzle will be displayed.
	
METHOD 2: 

    1. Input the data into <suduko.txt> file.
    
    2. Click the <RUN.bat> file and it will execute automatically.
    

In both the methods, the answer will be saved in <solution.txt> for reference.\
The **soduko.txt** already has a default Suduko grid to check the workings of the program.


*NOTE : This project requires python3 or above. Download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\
**RUN.bat** file will not work on any other OS other than Windows.*
